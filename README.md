# list-primes-golang

This is simple and understandable code to list all prime numbers below a positive integer in go lang.

Also known as the [Sieve of Eratosthenes](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sieve_of_Eratosthenes), this problem is very popular in coding interviews and excerices. 
So getting familiarized with the logics used to solve it will be really helpful once you have to face the challenge.

You can run the program and insert a prime number in the console input or otherwise comment that method and just change the value of variable n.
